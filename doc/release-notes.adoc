The Anypoint Connector for Elasticsearch lets you connect to the Elasticsearch from mule flows. The connector exposes convenient methods for exploiting the capabilities of Elasticsearch.

The connector executes API calls targeting Elasticsearch’s REST API depending on you configuration. The API calls use an JSON request/response over HTTP and HTTPS connection. 

Read through this user guide to understand how to set up and configure a basic flow using the connector. Track feature additions, compatibility, limitations, and API version updates using the Docker Connector Release Notes. Review the connector operations and see how they work by reviewing the Technical Reference alongside the Demo Applications.
